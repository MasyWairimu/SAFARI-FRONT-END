**THE SAFARI.TRAVEL WEBSITE**

The Safari.Travel website is a simple front-end website that displays different safari places one could take to travel Kenya. This being my first react Project, I did not focus on back-end or functionality but rather the front-end or the overview of the site.
In this READMe, I will add several screenshots of the website and add a link to the videos of the deployment of the website.
In this project, I used HTML, CSS and/or SCSS, JavaScript and React Node. The Wesbsite is user responsive to different screens as will be shown below.
In the components section of the site, I used four components or sections of the main page which are the:
    1. The Navigation Bar (NAVBAR) 
    2. The Home Component
    3. The Main Component
    4. The Footer Component

Functionality:
As mentioned earlier, I focused mainly on the front-end development of the website and therefore, the website does not do anything. It is mainly focused on the oveerview of the website.

Screen Responsiveness:
The Safari website is responsive to the different screen types available where it adjusts in accordance to ant screen that it might be used on which is critical for the user experience of any customer. As will be noticed over the videos that i will link, the website will change it's appearance whenever adjusted to whatever screen; whether a smartphone, a tablet, an  ipod, a laptop or even a desctop screen.

Video Links:
 This is a link that directs you to the videos which show the attributes and responsiveness of the website as well as it's oversight. I hope you enjoy.
