**THE SAFARI.TRAVEL WEBSITE**

The Safari.Travel website is a simple front-end website that displays different safari places one could take to travel Kenya. This being my first react Project, I did not focus on back-end or functionality but rather the front-end or the overview of the site.
In this READMe, I will add links to the videos and screenshots of the deployment of the website. The screenshots directory is in the **Safari Travels directory**
In this project, I used HTML, CSS and/or SCSS, JavaScript and React Node. The Wesbsite is user responsive to different screens as will be shown below. In addition, you can find the project here:
*https://masywairimu.github.io/SAFARI-FRONT-END/*

The code of the website is found in the **src directory** which is further split inro two other directories which are:-

    1. The assets directory - Contains the videos and pictures directories which are basically the resources for the code.
    2. The components directory- has code on all the components mentioned below.
    3. The AppFile.css file- contains the styling of the whole app in itself
    4. The index.js file - renders the app. Root file
    5. The AppFile.js file - th main file
    
In the components section of the site, I used four components or sections of the main page which are the:


    1. The Navigation Bar (NAVBAR) 
    2. The Home Component
    3. The Main Component
    4. The Footer Component

The other directories and files present are:-

        a. public directory -- !important
        b. package-lock.json file
        c. package.json file

Functionality:
As mentioned earlier, I focused mainly on the front-end development of the website and therefore, the website does not do anything. It is mainly focused on the oveerview of the website.

Screen Responsiveness:
The Safari website is responsive to the different screen types available where it adjusts in accordance to ant screen that it might be used on which is critical for the user experience of any customer. As will be noticed over the videos that is linked below, the website will change it's appearance whenever adjusted to whatever screen;    a smartphone, a tablet, an  ipad, alaptop or even a desctop screen.

Video and Screenshot Links:
 This is a link that directs you to the videos and screenshots which show the attributes and responsiveness of the website as well as it's oversight. I hope you enjoy.
