**THE SAFARI.TRAVEL WEBSITE**

The Safari.Travel website is a simple front-end website that displays different safari places one could take to travel Kenya.
In this READMe. I will add several screenshots of the website and furthermore add links to the videos of the deployment of the website.
In this project, I used HTML, CSS or SASS, JavaScript and React Node. The Wesbsite is user responsive to different screens as will be shown below.
In the component section of the site, I used four components or sections of the main page which are the:
    1. The Navigation Bar (NAVBAR) 
    2. The Home Component
    3. The Main Component
    4. The Footer Component

Functionality:
As mentioned earlier, I focused mainly on the front-end development of the website and therefore, the website does not do much. This is my first project using react after familiariing with it and more is still to be achieved. 

Screen Responsiveness:
The Safari website is responsive to the different screen types available where it adjusts in accordance to ant screen that it might be used on which is critical for the user experience of any customer. As will be noticed over the videos that i will link, the website will change it's appearance whenever adjusted to whatever screen; whether a smartphone, a tablet, an  ipod, a laptop or even a desctop screen.

Video Links:
